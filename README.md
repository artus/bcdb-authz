# bcdb-authz
## Using blockchain as an Authorization layer.

With `bcdb-authz`, you can use BigchainDB as an authorization layer among different peers. Each file  you want to author using `bcdb-authz` gets assigned a unique identifier, which will result in an asset that you can chain transactions on that alter the rights for different users. Users are also identified using a unique identifier, but are not stored as an asset on the BigchainDB network.  
  
This library is still in development, so check back later to see a working version!
